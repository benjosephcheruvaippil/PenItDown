            </p>

            <p>India is a land of diversity, I have heard it but now I am feeling it. After travelling to a couple of
                different states in India I can understand the diversity. This blog will be updated based on my travel
                journeys in future through India.</p>
            <p><strong><u>Rajasthan:</u></strong></p>
            <p>I went alone to Rajasthan. My first destination was Jaipur, the pink city of India. I didn&rsquo;t roam
                around the city since a friend was waiting for me in Udaipur - the city of lakes. Udaipur Lake is in the
                city centre and is a very nice sight. I stayed with Raju Borther&apos;s family there along with my
                friend Alwin. Went to places like Sajjangarh monsoon palace, City Palace in Udaipur and the mighty and
                stunning of all Chittorgarh fort which was quite some distance away from Udaipur.&nbsp;One Sunday I had
                a blessed worship in Philadelphia church.</p>
            <p>After Udaipur, my destination was Jaisalmeer where we could see the desert. The golden fort where I
                stayed was a different experience which I enjoyed thoroughly. The camel safari, sleeping in the desert,
                and walking in the streets of Jaisalmer were all memorable experiences.</p>
            <p><strong><u>Agra, Uttar Pradesh:</u></strong></p>
            <p>I intended to visit the Taj Mahal. Before going to the Taj Mahal I visited the &apos;Tomb of Akbar the
                Great&apos; - a very nice monument. Visited Agra Fort which was average for me. The day before I
                departed for Delhi I visited the best of all the Taj Mahal. The Taj Mahal was very clean and beautiful
                with all the marble artwork. It looked like a beautiful picture.</p>
            <p><strong><u>Delhi:</u></strong></p>
            <p>My friend Prince was waiting for me in Delhi. First, we together went to Chandini Chowk the big wholesale
                market in Delhi where we had a couple of sweets and chit-chatted and revisited our old memories. Went to
                the red fort but was just average to see. In the evening we roamed around the streets near his house and
                had some street foods. At night, my friend&rsquo;s mother prepared biriyani for us. The next day I
                departed for Jaipur to take my flight to Kerala.</p>
            <p><strong><u>Goa:</u></strong></p>
            <p>The party land/ the land of beaches in India. It never disappointed me. arrived at Madgaon and took a bus
                to the Baga beachside. I turn around and I could see most of the people is in a party mood either drunk
                or wanting to get drunk. I thoroughly enjoyed the atmosphere there. Such an atmosphere induces energy
                and positivity in us. The stay was in Gostops which was a hostel. I Met and talked with different folks.
                Went to Thalassa pub which was also a different experience since I never went to an open pub before. Not
                to mention the bike rides I had in Goa, which were also really good. Devil&rsquo;s finger beach was an
                exceptional place to see since it was a little dangerous as well as hidden from the public.</p>
            <p><strong><u>Pune, Maharashtra:</u></strong></p>
            <p>I reached the Pune railway station very early in the morning. Took a rikshaw and reached backpackers
                hostel which was one of a kind. Very cheap and pretty clean as well, worth every penny. Not to say the
                climate was pretty chill in the morning better than that of Banglore I assume. Saw Shaniwar vada fort,
                then walked a lot took the bus and then reached Aga Khan Palace where Gandhiji was sent to many months
                in jail just before the Quit India movement. Sihagad Fort was my destination the next day. Took the bus
                early in the morning. The experience I had was fantabulous, I never had such a trekking experience
                before even though there was a dangerous moment I had. After trekking for quite some time I reached the
                fort. It was an achieving kind of moment after all the hard work. Even though I couldn&apos;t spend much
                time up there it was a nice view from the top of the fort. I started my way down to the base of the
                fort.</p>
            <p><strong><u>Mumbai, Maharashtra:</u></strong></p>
            <p>They say Mumbai is a city, Bombay is a feeling. Even though my first impression of the city was not good
                I eventually started to enjoy it. Travelling on a local train filled with people and goods was an
                experience. Went to places like Daddar, Gateway of Mumbai, and saw The Taj Palace - which was attacked
                by terrorists on November 26, 2008. This place in Mumbai was a posh one. The marine drive was also a
                sight to see and walk around. In Mumbai also I walked kilometres and kilometres. Stayed in Gostops
                mumbai in masjid bandar. In the evening I went to Colaba causeway market where we could do shopping on
                the street side. The next day I returned on a train to Kerala which took around 24 hours and was one
                kind of experience as well.&nbsp;</p>
            <p><strong><u>Banglore, Karnataka:</u></strong></p>
            <p>I have worked and travelled to Bangalore several times. The first time I went there was in August 2019
                and I stayed there for almost 6 months which corona struck and I came back home to do work from home.
                Bangalore being the silicon valley of India has a lot of tech people living and working in numerous IT
                services companies. Nobody cares what you do and where you go cause everybody is busy with their lives
                and work. Bangalore also provides lots of financial opportunities for starting a business and for a
                career. I have gone to the famous Nandhi hills which I didn&apos;t feel very exceptional, Bannerghatta
                Zoo and many other local places around. Ever since 2019 I regularly visit the city till this
                writing.&nbsp;</p>
            <p><strong><u>Chennai, Tamil Nadu:</u></strong></p>
            <p>One of my friends named Akshay was working in Chennai in 2021. It was a three-day trip if I am not wrong.
                His cousin had a flat there which was quite away from the city centre but was a well-furnished 3BHK. We
                travelled to Mahabalipuram and saw Marina Beach and some other local spots. On the day of my departure,
                it was raining so heavily that it flooded the town. I was lucky and blessed enough to escape the floods
                and reach home safely.</p>
