                            Entrepreneurship</span></strong></u></p>

            <p>In my early mid-twenties, I started to develop a passion for business and entrepreneurship. I am a
                software developer and hence I started building applications for different use cases. The first product
                I tried to build and launch was Church management software. As the name suggests it was a church
                administration software which was a pretty new concept in Kerala(India) and South India during the time.
                Even though I cold-called some potential clients by getting their phone numbers from Google it
                didn&rsquo;t take off. 3-4 people showed interest but it didn&apos;t work out as expected.</p>
            <p>The next instinct was outside software but it was an interest I had from childhood. Sports Industry- I
                was a local footballer and was into fitness as well. So I tried to sell sports goods to local football
                turfs and other play areas. Even though some people bought it, I eventually dropped the idea.</p>
            <p>During corona and lockdown time, my friend and I tried to sell fast food online using a cloud kitchen
                model which was trending at that time. But we dropped it after trying to build the app.</p>
            <p>Up next I came back to a software product by building a Billing come accounting application for a
                potential client and eventually selling it to other clients as well. I started with the product build
                and reached a stage where I understood the architecture of the database had gone wrong. It was too late
                to change everything and start from the beginning. This encounter was painful. I dropped this idea and
                let the client down. But it was a great mental release for me since I was stressed out during that
                phase.</p>
            <p>Lessons learned:</p>
            <ul>
                <li style="font-weight: bold;">
                    <p><strong>Build products faster with minimum features and let users decide whether they want the
                            product or not. (ship more and more)</strong></p>
                </li>
                <li style="font-weight: bold;">
                    <p><strong>A simple proven idea is more than enough to launch a product rather than a genius
                            idea.</strong></p>
                </li>
                <li style="font-weight: bold;">
                    <p><strong>Only 10% of the products you build might survive and make some revenue.</strong></p>
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>Presently I am a failed solopreneur/entrepreneur. I wish to update this blog once I build something
                people would use.&nbsp;</p>
            <p>Thank you, Jesus.</p>
